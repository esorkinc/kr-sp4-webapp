    "        The U.S. was serviced by 143 Electricty providers as late as 2020. The providers were all private companies. \n",
    "        Some states like Georgia and Delaware had only one service provider, while Pennslyvannia and Wisconsin and 11 and 12 respectively.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Of the visualizations used in the analysis, the scatter plot providea great insight:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        **Rate Distribution Pattern**\n",
    "        The plot shows a clear positive correlation between commercial and residential rates, with most data points clustered along a consistent trend. \n",
    "        This pattern indicates that utilities tend to maintain proportional relationships between their commercial and residential rates, \n",
    "        likely reflecting similar underlying cost structures and market conditions across service areas.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        **Residential Premium**\n",
    "        One of the most striking features is that approximately `87.7%` of utilities charge higher rates to residential customers than commercial customers. \n",
    "        This is visualized by the large number of points above the red dashed `\"Equal Rates Line.\"` \n",
    "        The mean difference of `0.0243 $/kWh` represents a significant premium that residential customers pay compared to commercial users.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        This residential premium can be explained by several factors:\n",
    "        1. Infrastructure Costs: Residential service requires more extensive distribution networks and individual connections, increasing per-unit delivery costs.\n",
    "        2. Usage Patterns: Residential consumption tends to be more variable and peak-dependent, requiring utilities to maintain additional capacity.\n",
    "        3. Administrative Overhead: Managing many small residential accounts typically costs more per kilowatt-hour than fewer, larger commercial accounts.\n",
    "        4. Commercial and Industrial consumption per customer is usually much higher than residential, and may attract cheaper rates, \n",
    "        to decentivise commerial customers from investing in their own power plants.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        **Rate Clustering**\n",
    "        The visualization shows interesting clustering patterns:\n",
    "        - Most rates fall between `0.05 and 0.25 $/kWh` for both customer classes.\n",
    "        - There's greater variation in residential rates than commercial rates, shown by the vertical spread of points.\n",
    "        - The density of points is highest in the `0.10 - 0.15 $/kWh` range for commercial rates.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        **Outliers and Variations**\n",
    "        The scatter plot reveals several noteworthy outliers:\n",
    "        - Some utilities show rates above `0.30 $/kWh` for both customer classes.\n",
    "        - A small number of points fall below the equal rates line, representing unusual cases where commercial rates exceed residential rates.\n",
    "        - The spread increases at higher rate levels, suggesting more variability in pricing strategies among higher-cost utilities.\n",
